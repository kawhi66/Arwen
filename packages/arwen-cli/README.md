# Get started

[Arwen](https://github.com/kawhi66/arwen) has some interesting abilities that could be used for project management of frontend. Typically, arwen now could completely handle a [vue](https://cn.vuejs.org) project based on [h_ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/h_ui) component library.

Get started with a simple command `arwen create h_ui-demo`.  

Need more help, try `arwen --help`.
